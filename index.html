        <p> I really want to be done with this homework assignment but holy heck is it hard to bring all of the pieces together. I know that I am doing this for my own benefit but my neck hurts and my wireless earbuds are about to die. I am in this incredible state of discomfort that I can't move away from because I procrastinated and the deadline is in two hours. </p>
        <p> I may just turn this in tomorrow if it doesn't work because I am going to the Google class and that should bring back my points. I am doing fine in the class, but because of my lazy hubris, I am against the wall. This assignment is 60 points! Egads. Well, I can't spend too much time typing out this silly paragraph. It's just here as fluff anyway. Hello Rob. </p>
        <p> I will add one more paragraph just for the paragraph's sake. Not because when the author image gets bigger it interferes with the image underneath it. That would be horrible. No, everything on this site works fine and it will surely validate or else I will have an aneurysm and surely die. I hope to live to 120, so dying right now would be rather inconvenient. La vie est drole.</p>

        <p>Oh good, I have to come up with more things to type. I am already doing NaNoWriMo this month, so I will probably have carpal tunnel by the end of the week. Or does typing do that? I know that freehand writing sure does. Is it the luck of the draw? I kind of need my hands for all kinds of things.</p>
        <p>My book synopsis goes something like this: About ten years from now, everybody woke up one day with superpowers. Some are incredibly weak, like being able to type really quick, but some were incredibly strong and they were all distrubuted randomly. So basically there were ten years of chaos where prisoners escaped, martial law was enforced, and everything kind of sucked. The book starts at a point where there is this tenuous peace. It follows a psychologist whose power amplifies the negative emotions of anyone within a ten meter radius of him. As you can imagine, this sucks a lot and he can't do anything about it, so he opens a back alley clinic to try and help people whose powers are causing them stress.</p>
